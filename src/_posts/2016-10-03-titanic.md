## Initial Steps
### First Glance at Our Data


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

%matplotlib inline

filename = 'titanic_data.csv'
titanic_df = pd.read_csv(filename)
```

First let's take a quick look at what we've got:


```python
titanic_df.head()
```




<div>

</div>



### Handling Missing Values


```python
titanic_df.info()
```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 891 entries, 0 to 890
    Data columns (total 12 columns):
    PassengerId    891 non-null int64
    Survived       891 non-null int64
    Pclass         891 non-null int64
    Name           891 non-null object
    Sex            891 non-null object
    Age            714 non-null float64
    SibSp          891 non-null int64
    Parch          891 non-null int64
    Ticket         891 non-null object
    Fare           891 non-null float64
    Cabin          204 non-null object
    Embarked       889 non-null object
    dtypes: float64(2), int64(5), object(5)
    memory usage: 66.2+ KB
    

From this initial observation we notice that, from 891 passenger records:
- 714 have valid ages;
- only 204 have cabin records;
- 2 embarkments are missing.

The rows with missing ages and embarkment values will be dropped whenever an analysis depends on them.

The cabin values are not going to be used in this analysis, so they will not be touched.

### Other Considerations

I'm not going to analyze the number of Siblings/Spouses or Parents/Children isolatedly. Instead I am using the presence or not of family members aboard, represented by the 'Family' column.


```python
titanic_df['Family'] = (titanic_df['SibSp'] > 0) | (titanic_df['Parch'] > 0)
```

We also are going to need a column stating if a passenger is a child or an adult. 15 is going to be the childhood age threshold for our study.


```python
titanic_df['AgeRange'] = pd.cut(titanic_df['Age'], [0, 15, 80], labels=['child', 'adult'])
```

Now I'm getting rid of the data we are not going to use:


```python
titanic_df.drop(['PassengerId', 'Name', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Cabin'], axis=1, inplace=True)
```

Which leaves us with the following columns, plus 'Sex', 'Embarked' and 'Family':


```python
titanic_df.describe()
```

We can see that aproximately 38% of the passengers survived and the highest fare is over 15 times the average.

## Let's raise some questions:
1. What is the survival rate by class, sex and age? What about combining these factors?
2. Was the fare the same for men and women?
3. What fraction of the passengers embarked on each port? Is there a difference in their survival rates?
4. Is the presence of a family member a good indicator for survival?

### 1. What is the survival rate by class, sex and age? What about combining these factors?
Let's take a look at the distribution of passengers by age and fare, grouped by sex and class, and with survival information. It will give us some global insights about the data. But first, removing rows with missing ages:


```python
titanic_df_clean_age = titanic_df.dropna(subset=['Age'])
```


```python
def scatter_plot_class(pclass):
    g = sns.FacetGrid(titanic_df_clean_age[titanic_df_clean_age['Pclass'] == pclass], 
                      col='Sex',
                      col_order=['male', 'female'],
                      hue='Survived', 
                      hue_kws=dict(marker=['v', '^']), 
                      size=6)
    g = (g.map(plt.scatter, 'Age', 'Fare', edgecolor='w', alpha=0.7, s=80).add_legend())
    plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)
    g.fig.suptitle('CLASS {}'.format(pclass))

# plotted separately because the fare scale for the first class makes it difficult to visualize second and third class charts
scatter_plot_class(1)
scatter_plot_class(2)
scatter_plot_class(3)
```

It seems like women have a much higher survival rate, specially in first and second classes. It seems too that children have a higher survival rate, specially in first and second classes again. Let's find out the survival rate by class, sex and age range, and plot the results for a better understanding:


```python
survived_by_class = titanic_df_clean_age.groupby('Pclass')['Survived'].mean()
survived_by_class
```




    Pclass
    1    0.655914
    2    0.479769
    3    0.239437
    Name: Survived, dtype: float64




```python
survived_by_sex = titanic_df_clean_age.groupby('Sex')['Survived'].mean()
survived_by_sex
```




    Sex
    female    0.754789
    male      0.205298
    Name: Survived, dtype: float64




```python
survived_by_age = titanic_df_clean_age.groupby('AgeRange')['Survived'].mean()
survived_by_age
```




    AgeRange
    child    0.590361
    adult    0.381933
    Name: Survived, dtype: float64




```python
fig, (axis1,axis2,axis3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(16,6))

ax = survived_by_class.plot.bar(ax=axis1, color='#5975A4', title='Survival Rate by Class', sharey=True)
ax.set_ylabel('Survival Rate')
ax.set_ylim(0.0,1.0)
ax = survived_by_sex.plot.bar(ax=axis2, color='#5F9E6E', title='Survival Rate by Sex', sharey=True)
ax.set_ylim(0.0,1.0)
ax = survived_by_age.plot.bar(ax=axis3, color='#B55D60', title='Survival Rate by Age Range', sharey=True)
ax.set_ylim(0.0,1.0)
```




    (0.0, 1.0)




![png](/assets/images/titanic/output_25_1.png)


As expected (since we all watched the Titanic movie ðŸ˜‰), the first class has a higher survival rate than the second, which has a higher survival rate than the third, and women and children have a higher chance of survival than men and adults, respectively.

Now combining the three factors and visualizing the plots:


```python
grouped_data = pd.concat(
    [titanic_df_clean_age.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex', 'AgeRange'])['Survived'].mean(),
     titanic_df_clean_age.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex', 'AgeRange'])['Survived'].count()],
    axis=1)
grouped_data.columns = ['Survived', 'Count']
grouped_data
```

```python
g = sns.factorplot(
    x='AgeRange', 
    y='Survived', 
    col='Pclass',
    row='Sex',
    data=titanic_df_clean_age,
    margin_titles=True, 
    kind="bar", 
    ci=None)
```


![png](/assets/images/titanic/output_28_0.png)


Analysing the three factors combined gives us expected results too. It is interesting to see that even the women from the third class have a higher survival rate than the men from first. It indicates that saving women had a higher priority than saving the richer classes.

Saving children also seemed like a higher priority as on all permutations of factors except first class women, where one of three female children died, they had a higher survival rate. 

So we can conclude that saving women and children was indeed a priority on the Titanic shipwreck.

### 2. Was the fare the same for men and women?

While looking at the scatter plots shown in the first question I noticed that women seemed to be more spreaded among the 'Fare' axis, so it motivated me to check if the average fare paid by women was really higher than men's.

Let's check the mean fare paid by each sex:


```python
fare_by_sex = titanic_df.groupby('Sex')['Fare'].mean()
fare_by_sex
```




    Sex
    female    44.479818
    male      25.523893
    Name: Fare, dtype: float64




```python
ax = fare_by_sex.plot.bar(title='Fare Average and Sex')
ax.set_ylabel('Average Fare')
```




    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0xa7d69b0>




![png](/assets/images/titanic/output_32_1.png)


It indeed seems that women paid way more than men on average. Women's average fare is higher than I expected. Maybe it is due to the women of the first class. Let's group the data by class and check it out:


```python
fare_by_class_sex = titanic_df.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex'])['Fare'].mean()
fare_by_class_sex
```




    Pclass  Sex   
    1       female    106.125798
            male       67.226127
    2       female     21.970121
            male       19.741782
    3       female     16.118810
            male       12.661633
    Name: Fare, dtype: float64




```python
ax = fare_by_class_sex.plot.bar(figsize=(16,4), title='Fare Average by Class and Sex')
ax.set_ylabel('Average Fare')
```




    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0x8c7e590>




![png](/assets/images/titanic/output_35_1.png)


The average fare paid by women is higher than men's on every class, although the fares on second class are almost equal.
I wonder why women paid more... Maybe they demanded more privileges than men, but who knows...

### 3. What fraction of the passengers embarked on each port? Is there a difference in their survival rates?
Just for curiosity's sake, let's find out the proportion of passengers embarked on each port (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton), and their survival rates, but first, removing rows with missing embarkment values:


```python
titanic_df_clean_embarked = titanic_df.dropna(subset=['Embarked'])
```


```python
embarked = titanic_df_clean_embarked.groupby('Embarked').mean()
embarked['Count'] = titanic_df_clean_embarked['Embarked'].value_counts()
embarked
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Survived</th>
      <th>Pclass</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      <th>Fare</th>
      <th>Family</th>
      <th>Count</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Embarked</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>C</th>
      <td>0.553571</td>
      <td>1.886905</td>
      <td>30.814769</td>
      <td>59.954144</td>
      <td>0.494048</td>
      <td>168</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Q</th>
      <td>0.389610</td>
      <td>2.909091</td>
      <td>28.089286</td>
      <td>13.276030</td>
      <td>0.259740</td>
      <td>77</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>S</th>
      <td>0.336957</td>
      <td>2.350932</td>
      <td>29.445397</td>
      <td>27.079812</td>
      <td>0.389752</td>
      <td>644</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>




```python
fig, (axis1,axis2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14,6))

sns.countplot(x='Embarked', data=titanic_df_clean_embarked, order=['S','C','Q'], ax=axis1)
sns.barplot(x=embarked.index, y='Survived', data=embarked, order=['S','C','Q'], ax=axis2)
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0xa98cb30>




![png](/assets/images/titanic/output_40_1.png)


The survival rate for passengers embarked on Cherbourg is higher than both other ports'. That is no wonder, since the mean 'Pclass' value for this port is 1.89 - way lower than Queenstown's 2.91 and Southampton's 2.35 - which means that people that embarked there belonged to richer classes, which we've already seen that have better survival rates than the poorer ones.

### 4. Is the presence of a family member a good indicator for survival?
Finally, let's check if having a family member aboard means a higher survival chance:


```python
survived_by_family = titanic_df_clean_age.groupby('Family')['Survived'].mean()
survived_by_family
```




    Family
    False    0.321782
    True     0.516129
    Name: Survived, dtype: float64




```python
ax = survived_by_family.plot.bar(color='#5975A4', title='Survival Rate by Family Presence')
ax.set_ylabel('Survival Rate')
```




    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0xaa26b90>




![png](/assets/images/titanic/output_44_1.png)


The data shows that having a family member aboard indicates a better chance for survival. But why is that? Let's check some other numbers about family presence, like it's relation with class, sex and age range:


```python
family_by_class = titanic_df_clean_age.groupby('Pclass')['Family'].mean()
family_by_class
```




    Pclass
    1    0.537634
    2    0.462428
    3    0.366197
    Name: Family, dtype: float64




```python
family_by_sex = titanic_df_clean_age.groupby('Sex')['Family'].mean()
family_by_sex
```




    Sex
    female    0.616858
    male      0.328918
    Name: Family, dtype: float64




```python
family_by_age = titanic_df_clean_age.groupby('AgeRange')['Family'].mean()
family_by_age
```




    AgeRange
    child    0.927711
    adult    0.369255
    Name: Family, dtype: float64




```python
fig, (axis1,axis2,axis3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(16,6))

ax = family_by_class.plot.bar(ax=axis1, color='#5975A4', title='Family Presence by Class', sharey=True)

We can see that family presence is higher on:
- first class;
- female sex;
- children.

We have already discovered that these three factors show a higher survival rate, so maybe the higher survival rate for passengers with family members is more due to them than to the presence of family itself.

## Conclusion
All the results presented on this report just show correlations between pieces of data. It is important to highlight that correlation does not imply causation. To make statistically valid statements, tests like chi-squared tests and t-tests should be applied.

To discover if class, sex and age have a relationship with survival, we make four chi-squared tests - one for each variable individually, and one for all combined - and find out if they really do matter, as this study suggests.

The same goes to find out if the embarkment site or the presence of a family member have relationships with survival.

To find out if the average fare was the same for men and women we must hypothesize that there was no difference, and then make a t-test to check if the difference is significative as this study suggests.
